# Software Requirments

## Project Vision

There are things that we know we should do everyday, and habits we know would help us be healthier, happier people. However, a standard to-do list doesnt help us reach our goals of developing habits by repeating tasks throughout the week. This application aims to help people track their daily tasks over time, in order to help them create better habits. With this application, a user can add tasks to their week,  mark them as complete, and view their performance daily, weekly, and monthly. 

## Project Scope

+ User can sign up with their name, email address

## Project MVP

The minimum requirements for a working product are that we have created a website application for a user to visit, track their saved tasks and the performance of their habits over the week.

+ User can view their performance over the month -  monthly chart
