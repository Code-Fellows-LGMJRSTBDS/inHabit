inHabit is a daily habit tracker/checklist app

User Stories

1. As a user, I would like to track whether or not I am finishing all of my daily tasks. Seeing these tasks displayed in a simple visual layout and being able to mark them as finished would me organize and achieve my goals.

2. As a user, I would like to see a visual representation of my Habits. This would be even better if I could choose to view my progress over a weekly or monthly timeframe. Seeing a visual representation will help me identify trends in my performance.

3. As a user, I would like to see a leaderboard and public Habits of other users. This competitive element will help hold me accountable and add a fun social aspect.

4. As a user, I would like for finisihing tasks to *feel* good and I think that a nice animation on task completion would really deliver that dopamine hit I'm looking for.

5. As a user, I would like to see a history of all my accomplished and unaccomplished goals. Seeing a history could be useful if I am changing my goals frequently and would like to see what I was doing at a different time.
