inHabit is a daily habit tracker/checklist app
Being a modern day human with many esposibilities it is hard to keep mental track of everything that needs to be done day in and day out both professionally and at a personal level. That is why we created inHatbit! 
inHabit is an easy to use daily habit tracker/checklist app that allows you to write down what needs to be done and allows you to organize your to-do list by category. Research shows that it takes humans anywhere from 18 days to 254 days to develop a habit, so why not give yourself the edge over everyone else and start tracking what needs to be done and become the person you're destined to be. Use inHabit today!

### User stories:

1. As a user, I would like to track whether or not I am finishing all of my daily tasks. Seeing these tasks displayed in a simple visual layout and being able to mark them as finished would me organize and achieve my goals.

2. As a user, I would like to see a visual representation of my Habits. This would be even better if I could choose to view my progress over a weekly or monthly timeframe. Seeing a visual representation will help me identify trends in my performance.

3. As a user, I would like to see a leaderboard and public Habits of other users. This competitive element will help hold me accountable and add a fun social aspect.

4. As a user, I would like for finisihing tasks to *feel* good and I think that a nice animation on task completion would really deliver that dopamine hit I'm looking for.

5. As a user, I would like to see a history of all my accomplished and unaccomplished goals. Seeing a history could be useful if I am changing my goals frequently and would like to see what I was doing at a different time.

6. As a user, I would like to have a menu/task bar that is out of the way and only displays when I want to use it then it returns to being hiden.
