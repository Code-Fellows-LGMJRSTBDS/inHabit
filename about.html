        <h1>Liam Grist</h1>
        <p>I’ve wanted to learn to code forever but have always had too many responsibilities and side projects that I’ve been invested in to dive in. It took a pandemic to shut down a restaurant I was running for me to step back and start reprioritizing my passion for tech and interest in programming. I tried to jump in on my own, but realized that there are no shortcuts for learning to code, and finding a longer term, supportive bootcamp was essential. I hope to use my entrepreneurial spirit and array of skills I’ve picked up working with small businesses, to continue building a software development firm I’ve been working on with my brother over the last two years. </p>

        <h1>David Sitthideth</h1>
        <p>I was a patent assistant at a boutique law firm enagaged with patent prosecution before coming to Code
          Fellows. I decided to learn Software Development because I wanted to connect with my father and see how his
          life was when he was a software developer. I chose software development because I thought it would make me a
          better clinician if I ever chose to become a doctor later in life. I'd like to use it in an office setting at
          a large company like Microsoft. My military experience taught me to rely on others and not just go it alone
          like a lone wolf. To ask questions and follow the rules so that I could perform well and contribute to the
          group.</p>

        <h1>Rafael Sandoval</h1>
        <p>Prior to being a student here at Code Fellows I was a contractor for the US NAVY working as an Engineer
          Technician III. I have never been a computer savvy individual, but looking around I can tell that the Tech
          industry is the future. So I made the tough decision to discontinuen working a hard labor job and began
          learning software development. The journey has not been easy but the reward of having a better life for myself
          and my loved ones is far greater than the obstacles in front of me. They are the reason why I push myself to
          become a great developer. I also bring to the table all of my skills as NON COMISSIONED OFFICER in the US ARMY
          to the table to provide purpose, direction, and motivation to those around me. I look forward to working with
          all of you in the near future. </p>

        <p>I was previously a Russian linguist in the Air Force for about nine years. I enjoy learning languages and
          also building things
          from scratch. I started a web developer course on Udemy and it seemed like the perfect fit. Although I am
          looking forward to all the aspects of web development, I really want to
          focus as a front end web dev. </p>
